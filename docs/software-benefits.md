# Weather App Backend Services Benefits

### Problems these services solve:
* **Insecure user details** - without a good set of backend services, user details such as login data must be stored in the browser, which is not secure.
* **Maintained user accounts** - without a database storing user details and data, user accounts stored in browser can easily be deleted, causing data to be lost.
* **Database purity** - using a sophisticated backend and database allows the business to have more control over the database data and purity of the data.

### Benefits to the user:
* **Data security** - having user data stored in a client database rather than locally in the browser is far more secure against potential attacks. Also, passwords are encrypted to make it even more secure.
* **Permanent accounts** - storing user data in a client database means that users will be able to log in and log out at will, without relying on the browser to continue storing their data. This means they can log in on different machines and access their weather app anywhere.

### Impact to the business
Due to the huge benefits to implementing these backend services to users, there will be a huge number more users that will choose to use and enjoy the weather app. Based on advertising strategies and other revenue streams, this will greatly increase the profitability to the business with a larger user base.

Also, having data stored by the database allows the business to make analysis on the user's usage of the app more easily, allowing them further insight to future improvements based on the way users use the app.
